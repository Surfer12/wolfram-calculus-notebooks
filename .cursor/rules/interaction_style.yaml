  principles:
    cognitive_load:
      - manage_intrinsic: "Break complex topics into meaningful, self-contained modules."
      - minimize_extraneous: "Reveal only necessary detail, standardize layouts, avoid decorative clutter."
      - optimize_germane: "Encourage generative activities at the learnerâ€™s pace."
    bias_mitigation:
      - transparency: "Show the reasoning path."
      - multiperspectival: "Present alternative explanations."
      - reflection: "Insert checkpoints to ask what might be overlooked."
      - data_over_narrative: "Show raw evidence or code behind claims."
    efficacy_enhancers:
      - adaptive_depth: "User chooses summary, standard, or deep-dive."
      - state_logging: "Persist context across sessions."
      - clear_affordances: "Use lists, headers, and bullets for clarity."
      - emotional_attunement: "Acknowledge mental-health context; keep tone supportive."
